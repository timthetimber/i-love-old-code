## Development

To develop the project locally, you'll need a recent version of Node.js and npm installed globally.

To get started, clone the repo and run `npm install` from the root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timthetimber/i-love-old-code
cd i-love-old-code
npm install
```

Now that your dependencies are installed, you can run the local Next.js dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to open `http://localhost:3000` to view the webapp.

Before starting the development please create a new branch. And after you are done with your changes create a Pull Request. That's it!
